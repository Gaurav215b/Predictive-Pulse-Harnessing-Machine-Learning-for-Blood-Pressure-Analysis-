# Blood Pressure Analysis and Stage Prediction

This project uses machine learning to analyze blood pressure data and predict the severity stage of a patient. It includes:

-  Data analysis using Jupyter Notebook
-  ML model to predict blood pressure stage
-  Streamlit-based web app for real-time prediction

##  Features

- Predict BP Stage with meaningful output (e.g. **Stage 1 - Mild Hypertension**)
- Display confidence of predictions
- Give attention level suggestions (e.g. “🚨 Critical - Immediate doctor consultation advised”)

---

##  Dataset

- **File**: `patient_data.csv`
- Contains: age, gender, blood pressure levels, symptoms, diagnosis, and medication info.

---

##  ML Models Used

- XGBXGBoost

Trained to classify patient BP stage using features like:
- Systolic and Diastolic values
- Diagnosis time
- Medication intake
- Symptoms like nose bleeding, breath shortness, etc.

---

##  How to Run Web App

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run BP_web.py
```

---

##  Future Enhancements

- Add model explainability (e.g. SHAP or LIME)
- Deploy to cloud (Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces)
- Add history tracker for patient visits
